# Natural Language Processing (Capstone Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the domain of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. The primary objective is to apply advanced NLP techniques such as **sentiment analysis**, **text summarization**, **language modeling**, or **question answering** using state-of-the-art tools and libraries.

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   Example: IMDB movie reviews dataset or similar text corpus

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization  
   - Vectorization using Word2Vec, GloVe, or contextual embeddings (BERT, etc.)

3. **Model Development**  
   - Choose architecture: Bi-LSTM, Transformer, BERT, etc.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning and fine-tuning on labeled data

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, BLEU, ROUGE  
   - Visual performance comparison with baseline models

## 🧪 Results

Example (replace with your actual results):
- Achieved **92% accuracy** on IMDB dataset
- Outperformed traditional ML methods (Naïve Bayes, SVM) by ~10%
- Clear improvement in contextual understanding and generalization

## 🌐 Applications

- 📢 **Sentiment Analysis**: Social media monitoring, feedback analytics  
- 🧾 **Text Summarization**: News, legal, and academic content compression  
- 🌍 **Machine Translation**: Language accessibility and globalization  
- 🤖 **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**: Enhanced conversational agents  
- 🏥 **Healthcare NLP**: Clinical note summarization, mental health indicators  
- 🛍 **E-Commerce**: Product recommendation, review insights
